Welcome to **particles**' documentation!
========================================

This package was developed to complement the book: 

`An introduction to Sequential Monte Carlo <https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030478445>`_

by Nicolas Chopin and Omiros Papaspiliopoulos.

The scripts used to perform the numerical experiments discussed in the book may
be found in folder ``book``.

The documentation refers sometimes to the book for some theoretical details,
but otherwise is meant to be self-sufficient. 

To get an overview of what **particles** can do, we strongly recommend that you
have a look at the **notebook tutorials** first (see `overview` section).  

To get help on a specific module, class, function, etc., see the indices below,
or use the ``help`` command in python::

    from particles import resampling as rs
    help(rs)  # help on module resampling 
    help(rs.multinomial)  # help on a specific function in that module
